Title: An Advanced TicTacToe game using *MiniMax Algorithm*
Description: This is a complete Tictactoe game, it includes many functionalities, you can play games
against another human, you can play against the computer, you can also even let the computer
play against itself. The A.I is very good, actualy it is unbeatable, the most you can do is to 
draw the games. Also, the game include statistics (number of win, draw an lost games) for the
current match between players. The A.I for this tictactoe game is an implementation of the
MiniMax Algorithm, the algorithm was implemented by using three functions, Minimax(...),
MinMove(...) and MaxMove(...), as you probably may have guest it, the main function in this
algorithm is MiniMax(...), it returns the best move for the current computer player.
To be capable of choosing the best move, the program takes time to generate all the possible
outcomes for the current board position and at the same time, it decide wich one is the best.
